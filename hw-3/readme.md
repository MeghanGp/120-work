# HW-3

I found this week to be much less confusing than the last, although I personally had to repeat quite a few steps due to building/using a new computer this week. On the bright side, having to revisit some of the steps from last week *was* helpful, tedious as it may have been. It was mostly just small things, for example, once I set up my new GitHub Desktop app I had to add my 120-work repository again and it kept telling me it wasn't a Git repository. At first I was thinking "What? How?!" but, alas, I remembered I had to go set that up in powershell. To my surprise I remembered the commands!

## Issues with Atom

As I mentioned, I moved over to my new computer finally this week. Last week, on my laptop, Atom just did not want to open after the inital launch (I did run as administrator) and the only way I could find it was in my "hidden files", even then it didn't want to open. Once I moved over to my new computer, I ran into the same exact problem again. I did look for a solution in the "issues" tab, but until yesterday it seems no one else had experienced this problem. As odd as it is, the only thing I could do to fix this was pinning Atom to my taskbar once it launched the first time. I did share this with the other individual running into what sounded like a similar problem.

### Expanding My Knowledge

There are multiple things I'd like to learn more about, but I know we will in the weeks to come. I was curious about how to set different color backgrounds that weren't basic and greyscale, such as using RGB, but again I'm sure we'll delve into these things more soon. For a while there, I created themes for websites like "Tumblr" but I had stopped after a while and in that time I had forgetten a bit of what I  had learned. It has already been nice revisiting a lot of these things, and seeing some of the topics we will go into in the near future is fairly exciting.

#### Git Repo 120-work

I chose to remake my 120-work file and transfer the contents from my old computer to my new one, and as such I had to publish a secondary 120-work repo to GitHub. It is difficult to explain why I needed to do this, (I know, I *could have* just transfered the whole thing) but for me it was simply easier/less confusing to do it the way I did between my computers. I renamed my old repo on GitHub "120-work-1.0" so that my hw-2 assignment may still be seen. I will continue using the new one I published this week as instructed in the future. I thought I might clarify this so it does not appear confusing/odd during grading.
