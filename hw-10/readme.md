# Overall Assignment

I found this assignment easily understandable and also very useful. However, I would like to get down arrays of objects. Rather than creating a new assigment I went with refactoring an old one, assignment 6 I believe. For me this made arrays extremely easy to understand. To practice with it, I changed the numbers within the array I created as well as created multiple shapes utilizing the same array.

## Issues

When I was first reading the modules for this assignment it *seemed* like a lot to take in, but the concept of arrays is fairly easy to understand. This is not to say, though, that I cannot develop and further my understanding of the function. This assignment helped me understand the basics and I experienced minimal issues with the actual assignment itself. My issue with this assignment was actually attempting to do it. It's aparent that doubting oneself results in mental handicapping.

## Process

Initially I was thinking this assignment would take quite a bit of time to understand. I kept reading and speculated back on previous homework assignments as references for possibilities. As I stated earlier, I chose to refactor a previous assignment in order to understand the concept best. I began by altering a previous assignment and updating the code with an array. Once this was done I changed the array values a few times and reflected on the changes before settling on a final size. After that, I created two more rectangles ( each with a rectangle within itself ) using the same array I previously created, each placed 300 pixels apart on the screen.

# Future

In the future I'd like to continue utilizing arrays. I aim to learn how may use arrays in making whole objects and setting changing colors as these would be the most beneficial situations to use an array.
