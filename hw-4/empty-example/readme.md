[Monster Portrait Sketch](https://meghangp.github.io/120-work/hw-4/)

# *Overall Assignment*

I had a lot of fun with this assignment overall. Admittedly, I'd only gone over the first couple pages and jumped right in as an attempt to learn as much from my mistakes as possible. Soon I started wondering "can I do this? can I do that?" and had to jump back over to the module for information. The biggest problem I ran into was using translate, but near the middle of the assignment I started understanding it more. I started throwing different shape functions in and seeing what I could work with and it slowly began to come together. At first I wasn't sure if I'd rather do a portrait or a monster, but I was quick to choose making a monster (hopefully a cyclops space ghost counts) because it's October! I also enjoyed messing around with colors a bit more, having the color-picker makes quite a difference compared to last week.

## *Issues*

I'm surprised I didn't run into many issues this assignment, the first was after a bit of working my sketch stopped showing in the browser. I scrolled through and looked for my mistakes, changed a few things, and got it working again. Next was using translate, I was confused at first and mostly entering whatever numbers would work and put things where I wanted them. Eventually I got it down a bit better, but I could still use a lot of practice. My biggest mistake was probably choosing 300 as my center, which made it a little wonky when it came to placing things just right.I hadn't decided on it/realized it until much further into my assignment, at which point I deemed it was to late to turn back. Secondly, I was having trouble with all my shapes in one sandbox moving when I rotated or moved only one. Soon I realized I could simply use an additional translate funtion above the other shapes.

### *Process*

For me, most of this assignment was simply trial and error. I didn't have many problems with code break or things just not working for me. Generally, it was "this number or that number?" when it came to placement. I also ran into uncertainty, I didn't want my project to end up *too* minimalistic, so I added a few things to the background. It's odd for me creating art this way, since generally I just hop onto photoshop with my drawing pad, but I found it to be an enjoyable learning experience. At the same time, it was a little frustrating because of the way I usually do art, much more indepth art at that. There were definitely times when I was wishing I could just drag and drop a shape where I wanted it to be.

#### *Furthering Skills*

To be honest, ~~I wasn't exactly thrilled with my end result~~ because it's terrible compared to art I generally make. At the same time though, I know this isn't the same kind of art and I have plenty of time to improve what I can do in this form. I'm looking forward to seeing what we will do with 3D shapes.
