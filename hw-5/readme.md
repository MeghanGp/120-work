# *Review*

For me, the hardest part about this assignment was deciding on *what* to make. For whatever reason, the moving of 3D objects for me is much easier than 2D. I struggled a lot with this assignment when I was trying to use 2D shapes, and it simply wasn't working out. The process was making my mind a little numb, so I ended up practicing with 3D objects for this assignment instead (I hope this was okay, I included each element). I didn't expect some things to work as smoothly as they did, I had a little trouble getting the planet rings to do exactly what I wanted, but I eventually got them to line up with one another. The secondary ring I used was moving way to fast at first, too. This aspect of the assignment got me more familiar with frame rate and controlling it.

## *Problems*

I wanted to add a frame rate count to my assignment, or text of some kind, but anytime I attempted to add it, it would make everything else in the sketch stop moving/reacting. I couldn't seem to find a solution, but I am guessing it has something to do with using WEBGL. I ended up ignoring this issue for now, since I am not all that familiar with using WEBGL yet. I chose to use 3D over 2D because for whatever reason, I just could not wrap my head around what was going on when trying to use 2D. Again, I wish I'd stopped to take a screenshot of my work when the text wasn't working for this example right now.

### *Process*

I spent a lot of this assigment messing around with different shapes, variables, roatations, etc. while trying to think of what to make. Generally, I roam around the P5 References/Examples pages and try my hand at making new things. That's how I ended up with the 3D objects instead; while I was playing with different functions, some things began to become more understandable and I *finally* got an idea. It's funny to me that it took so long to think of something that ended up so simple, but I suppose that will happen with a distracted mind.

#### *Future Assignments*

For future assignments, I'd like to make something with *more* to it. This assignment came out pretty simplistic for me, I feel, as the most important thing became getting it done at a reasonable time because personal matters have tilted this week for me a bit. Regardless, I got a decent amount of practice in this week. Another thing I'd like to do in the future is remember to document issues during my work process for the "readme". It's something I always forget to do, because I'm determined to fix it/find the problem.
