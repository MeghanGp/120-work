# Overview of hw-8

I found this week easy to understand, but I feel as though much more can be done with this information than I could think of for this assignment. I've constantly run into a problem where I have no ideas for things like this. It feels similar to writers block, this sometimes affects me with other forms of creativity as well. Even so, I was able to understand the use of for loops and that *is* the point of the assignment!

## Issues

During this assignment, I did not run into any issues as I made a fairly simple sketch.

## Process

Generally, I watch the provided videos if offered for assignments. I find many of them very helpful and often times they broaden my understanding of different actions/loops and things because they are given a wider explanation. I didn't do much with loops and demonstrate it several times this assignment, but I did learn that they make adding multiple objects much easier. This would have definitely helped me in past assignments for ideas I wanted to put into my sketches but could not.

## Future Assignments

For future assignments my goal is to find a good way to combine many of the things we've learned so far. Although I've had the opportunity to do so, I did not combine multiple things that we have learned so far for this assignment. I don't feel as though I generally fall short in this area, but it is something I'd like to avoid in order to get the most practice out of assignments. I believe the reason for some of my issues (the idea block, lack of combination) is that I need to give some of the things we go over additional practice, especially if I did not use a couple things in that assignment for my code.
