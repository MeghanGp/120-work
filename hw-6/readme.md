# *Overview*

At first, this week seemed intimidating in general because I sometimes struggle with math. Regardless I continued reading through the material for this week and found it wasn't so intimidating afterall. Fortunately I'm not so bad at the type of math we're using, and it ended up making complete sense to me. The biggest issue I ran into while working on this weeks homework was again, my whole sketch disappearing when I add in other functions. Other than that, I didn't have very many. I experimented a lot with the positioning and coloring of things, as well as the random function. This assignment went fairly smooth.

## *Issues*

As I said previously, it seems adding in additional functions sometimes causes my sketch to disappear altogether or stop moving. I'm still not sure what exactly is triggering this issue, but every time it happens I'm able to fix it *some how*.. it's just unclear what is fixing it/causing the problem. Generally I'll move the chunk of new code I added that caused everything to disappear, and eventually it ends up in a spot that works? I understand this means it must be the order of content, but I don't necessarily understand **what** is the exact problem or **why**.

### *Process*

I started with trying to make the background change color with the movement of mouseX. Next I added the constrain function and added a rectangle to follow the mouse. After that, I was unsure what else to add. I tried adding random shapes but didn't like the outcome, so eventually I ended up with a centered rectangle. Somewhere inbetween all that I made an attempt at making my first object, which also gave my trouble at first and caused the sketch to stop moving. After moving the object code, everything began working smoothly again. Finally I had to adjust the size of things, and I was done before I knew it.

### *Future*

In the future I'd like to continue practicing with math in order to improve my skills. It seems I've been putting of math for long enough, and really it isn't as bad as I remember! So far I haven't ran into very many problems in this course, which means I haven't had much experience with troubleshooting my codes. I'd like to get more familiar with troubleshooting so that in the future, I *can* figure out what the problem in my code might be, or help someone else with an issue they're having.
